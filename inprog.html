  Oh cool, you're reading my code. To note, at the time of coding this website, I've recently been rejected from a dream job at my childhood location and currently pissed. So to negate this. 
  I have drafted and made this website in hopes to fill a gap. In my opinion. Instead of getting pissy about rejection, work on yourself, and apply yourself 
  to be better than what you were at rejection. Whether rejection be through work or in relationships, the need for "payback" is typically felt within a person. 
  I feel that, if you want "payback", build yourself to be better than that job or person. Because soon enough, you'll reach a stage where you know that you 
  dont need to do anything back to them. Because you've built yourself to be better.

  Now thats out of the way. I'm still iffy on HTML and JS coding but by the end of this websites developement (side note: You can never truly finish a project) i'll
  have learnt a good amount to make myself happy. I hope it reflects itself in code.
